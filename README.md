# LabsSearch
Fast keyword search app for iOS. On the Apple App Store as [Chears].

## App Store description
Quickly search for images, videos, and more using your preferred search services.

Easily add your own favourite sites and apps, or use the most popular services already included.

See the results quickly in Chears, or have them open automatically in Safari or other apps.

## Project background
This is [my] first iOS project. It took way too long to complete as I used it to learn Swift, the Apple ecosystem, and general programming concepts. Although the app is working and can be installed, it represents my earliest efforts to code, and therefore is messy. Hopefully by making the code viewable, others can learn from my mistakes. Maybe they'll also find ways to improve the app, or find some tips for their own app(?!).

## Points of interest
* The working title for this app is **LabsSearch**, while the published name is **Chears**. Sorry for the confusion.
* English is the base language, with full Korean localization available.
* As the primary purpose of writing this app was to experiment with code, no third-party software or packages were used. As such, two modules were created for use in the app: A favicon fetcher, and a character encoder/decoder. These will be broken out into separate repositories at a later time.

## To do
The app has a massive list of (theoretically) planned features, as well as bugs to be fixed. These were tracked in a flat text document, and as such do not have any issue tracking attached to them. These may be uploaded individually in the future, but probably not.
